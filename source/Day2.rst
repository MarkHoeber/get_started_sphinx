C. Grow *E.coli* cells
**********************

1. Remove your streaked agar plate from the 37°C incubator. You should see bacterial growth on the plate. The growth will be most abundant at streak #1 and it will get progressively scarcer for streak #2 and #3.  There should be single colonies visible on streak #3, see Figure 3.

2. Working near a Bunsen burner, pour/ pipette 10 mL of sterile LB into a sterile test tube or conical tube.

3. Using a sterile inoculation loop, open the lid of the Petri dish. Touch the loop to a single colony.

4. Place the inoculated loop into the LB and gently swirl the loop in the broth to ensure you inoculate it. Cover the opening of the tube with aluminum foil. This is your 'starter culture'.

5. Incubate the tube at 37°C overnight on a shaking platform.
