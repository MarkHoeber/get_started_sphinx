Making and Editing Your First Blog Post
***************************************

#. Once you’ve purchased your domain through a hosting provider, you’ll be asked to choose a plan that will give you the ability to blog. A basic plan starts at $5 a month, and allows you to connect your domain to the Wix site as well.
#. Now it’s time to write your blog post. After you log into Wix, you’ll see a grid of apps under the section My Apps. Click on the one titled Blog.
#. This will take you to the All Posts section. Once you create some posts, they will be listed on the screen in reverse chronological order.
#. Next, you want to click on the blue New Post button displayed in the previous picture located at the top right hand corner of the screen.
#. Your blank template should appear on the screen. You’ll see fields where you can enter the title of your post, and the body of the article directly below.
#. At the very top, you’ll see a row of buttons where you can add a variety of media to your blog post. These buttons are:

* Image
* Gallery
* Video
* Music
* GIF
* Divider
* HTML

Begin typing your content into the title and body. Once you've finished, you can preview the post before you publish it by clicking on the **Preview** button in the right hand column.


Once you’ve finished typing your post and everything is all set, click on the blue Publish Post button on the right hand side of the screen. You can also choose to schedule the post to publish at a later time by clicking on the upside down triangle menu next to the Publish Post button on the right.

Now, you’ve successfully published your first blog post! Once it’s up, it’s a good idea to post a link to the article on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This will allow readers to find your blog and check out the post that you’ve just published. It also gives readers the chance to check out some of the other work you’ve created as well.
