Making a mixed drink
********************

A task typicallly follows conceptual information. Task titles should be imperative. Tasks should have a short introduction sentence that captures the user's goal and introduces the steps, for example, "Verify your products are in the catalog:"

A task should have 3 - 7 steps.  Tasks with more should be broken down into digestible chunks.

Intro sentence.

#. Gather the ingredients for the drink.

#. Setup mixing glass and tin, put small amount of ice in mixing glass.

#. Pour one part of gin, vodka, tequila, rum in any order.

#. Add one part triple sec.

#. Add two part sweet and sour.

#. Put mixing tin on the glass, then shake drink.

#. Strain drink into ice filled serving glass.

#. Fill the rest with coke. 

#. Add a lemon as a garish and a straw.

At that point the drink is ready to be served.
