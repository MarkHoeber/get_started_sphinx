# Get Started with Sphinx

This repo stores a skeleton Sphinx project. Students can use fork this
repository and use it to test the Sphinx setup on their computers, and as a
starting point for new Sphinx projects.

To build this project, in the command prompt, enter `make html`.

To view the html output, open the file `build/html/index.html`.
